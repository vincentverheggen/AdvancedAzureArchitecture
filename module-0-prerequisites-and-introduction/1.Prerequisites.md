  ```bash
  sudo apt install git       # For Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo yum install git       # For CentOS/RedHat
  ```

To verify the installation, run:

  ```powershell
  git --version
  ```

### 3. Install Azure CLI

Azure CLI is essential for managing Azure resources from the command line. Install it using the instructions below:

- **Windows**:
  - Download the installer from [Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli).
  - Run the installer and follow the prompts.

  - Use the following commands:

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash  # For Debian/Ubuntu
  sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc
  sudo dnf install azure-cli                             # For CentOS/RedHat
  ```

To verify the installation, run:

```powershell
az --version
```

### Step 5: Install Visual Studio Code

For this course, we recommend using **Visual Studio Code** as your text editor. It's lightweight, highly customizable, and offers excellent support for coding.

#### 5.1 Download Visual Studio Code

1. Visit the [Visual Studio Code official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Click the download button for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

#### 5.2 Install Visual Studio Code

1. Once the download is complete, open the installer:
   - **Windows**: Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard.
   - **macOS**: Open the downloaded `.dmg` file, drag the Visual Studio Code icon to your `Applications` folder.
   - **Linux**: Follow the instructions provided for your distribution on the download page (e.g., using `deb` or `rpm` packages).

#### 5.3 Launch Visual Studio Code

- Open Visual Studio Code after installation:
  - On **Windows** or **macOS**, find it in your Start Menu or Applications folder.
  - On **Linux**, use your system launcher or run `code` from the terminal if added to your path.

#### 5.4 Configure Visual Studio Code for PowerShell Scripts

Visual Studio Code will be used in this course to run PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts line by line.

1. Install the **PowerShell Extension**:
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (`Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
   - Search for **PowerShell** and click **Install**.

2. You can now run individual lines or blocks of code by selecting them and pressing `F8`.

3. Tip for Previewing Markdown in VS Code:

To preview your Markdown file in **Visual Studio Code**, press `Ctrl + K, then V`. This will open the preview pane, allowing you to see the rendered version of your Markdown file.


#### 5.5 Clone your Github repository

1. From **Source Control** tab select **Clone Repository** and follow the prompts to authenticate with GitHub in the browser and return to VS Code.
2. From the GitHub repository dropdown you can filter and pick the repository you want to clone locally, select yours.

## Next Steps

1. Once you have completed the prerequisites:

   1. Confirm that you can access the Azure portal with your subscription.
   2. Verify that Git and Azure CLI are properly installed and accessible from your terminal.
   3. Make sure that Visual Studio Code and the Powershell extension are installed and you can run them.

   If you encounter any issues, please reach out to the course instructor or consult the provided documentation.

2. Proceed with deploying a few resources in Azure to get started with the course content: [2.Introduction.ps1](./2.Introduction.ps1).

Happy Learning!
