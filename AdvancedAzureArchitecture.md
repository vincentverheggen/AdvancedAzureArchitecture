## Description

It is often challenging for application teams that are hosting in the cloud to live up to their part of the shared responsibilities of using the full potential of the cloud platform they are on. This workshop puts you on the path to achieve that potential.

This workshop aims to enhance your comprehension of the principles and practices necessary to fully realize the potential of cloud computing. The cloud made some promises, including but not limited to pay-per-use, business agility, resiliency with geo fail-over, self-healing, and improved security, and it is up to you and your team to keep those promises.

As a software architect, you aspire to broaden your architectural expertise and leverage the cloud's capabilities without encountering significant risks. This workshop assumes a foundational knowledge of Azure and software patterns and aims to enhance your skills in key areas critical for achieving cloud excellence.

The workshop is structured into the following modules:

1. **Azure Architecture Introduction:** An overview of Azure's global infrastructure and architectural building blocks. It delves into the complexity of Azure's region pairs, availability zones, and the architectural design principles that ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery.
2. **External Communication:** This module covers options for managing external communication, including API Gateway, API Management, Azure Front Door, and the use of webhooks for integrating with external systems.
3. **Scaling Strategies:** Explores various scaling strategies for applications and databases, including app service plan scaling, orchestrators, and techniques for scaling databases to meet demand.
4. **Caching Strategies:** This module discusses various caching strategies to improve the performance and reliability of applications, including caching patterns, Azure Redis Cache, and Content Delivery Network (CDN).
5. **Security Best Practices:** An intro to advanced security architectures, including Zero Trust, data encryption, and threat protection. Topics include Azure Key Vault, Private Endpoints, Azure Firewall, and using Azure Sentinel for comprehensive threat detection and response.
6. **Microservices Architecture:** Focuses on designing, deploying, and managing microservices on Azure, covering the use of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), service mesh technologies, and best practices for microservices architecture.
7. **Message Brokers:** Advanced concepts and use cases associated with Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Grid, including handling large message volumes, advanced routing, message deduplication, handling message failures, and integrating third-party services.
8. **Observability and Monitoring:** Emphasizes the importance of observability and monitoring in Azure, covering how to set up autoscaling and diagnose application performance with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

By the end of this workshop, you will have a comprehensive understanding of advanced Azure architecture and be equipped with the skills to design, implement, and manage complex cloud solutions that fulfill the promises of cloud computing.
