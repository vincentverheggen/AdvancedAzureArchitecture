# Module 6: Microservices Architecture

In this module, you will learn how to securely manage sensitive information and monitor the performance of your containerized applications in Azure.

You will start by exploring secrets management using Azure Key Vault. You will learn how to securely store critical data like API endpoints and configure access controls using Managed Identities. By the end of this part, you’ll understand how to keep your application secrets safe and integrate them into a containerized environment.

Next, you’ll dive into logging and monitoring using Azure Monitor and Azure Storage. You’ll set up diagnostic settings to capture application logs, store them in a secure location, and learn how to access and analyze these logs. This will help you monitor your app’s health and troubleshoot issues effectively.
