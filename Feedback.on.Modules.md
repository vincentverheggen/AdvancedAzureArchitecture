# Feedback on modules

Magnus is asking around to have feedback on modules. This is an unfiltered log of feedback, one bullet per feedback item from someone.

* Module on Governance och cost optimization.
* Module on disaster/recovery.
* Here are some thoughts (from one person):
  * Identity and Access Management.
  * Hybrid/multi-cloud architecture.
  * Serverless computing (Azure Functions, Logic Apps).
  * Compliance (Which is sort of Governance).
  * Data services and Analytics (What data-persistance options are there? What data-migration strategies are there? How can you use Azure-services to gain insight into your data? etc.)
  * DevOps/Automation (IaC, CI/CD, etc).
* Personal thoughts:
  * Module 7: Message Brokers. I'd rename to Messaging. Unless your focus is strictly on the brokers and their internals.
  * Module 6: Microservices Architecture. I suspect that to become a worms can. It's a topic that can take a course on its own. Not to mention that there are multiple schools on what Microservices should look like.
  * Module 8: Observability and Monitoring. Personally, I like that the module comes last and could connect the dots for everything.
* Maybe add Governance and cost management? Or maybe they can be included somewhere.
* On module 8... Please don't call monitoring observability.... And explain what true observability is (too many Ã -holes see monitoring as observability and thus only cover metrics).
